        The angry bird game helped me understand the physics engine and how to use constraints, and even to change the tint of a
        sprite.

    <br><p>
        The T-rex game helped me understand different concepts like how to make an infinite game and how to add gravity to your
        game.

        The Ghost-Tower game helped me understand how to do the same thing as the t-rex game, but vertically.
